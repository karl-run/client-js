            <h3>Fetch references to external object</h3>
            <p>
                In most cases having the resolved references mounted on the result
                structure is very convenient. However, sometimes you might want to
                keep the original response as is, or you may want to have a map of
                resolved references that can be re-used later. To do so, you can
                use the same resolveReferences option but combine it with graph: false.
                Then, the result will contain two properties - data and references.
            </p>
